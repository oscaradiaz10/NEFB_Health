            <h1>Individual & Family Plans</h1>
            <p>Are you under 65 years of age and want an alternative to the Insurance Marketplace for your health coverage needs? Nebraska Farm Bureau Health Plans has a broad range of coverage plans to suit just about everyone's particular health care needs for level of coverage, deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket payments, preventative health benefits and more.</p>
            <p>Whether you are the head of a family interested in well-child benefits, a graduating student looking for health care coverage for the first time, self-employed or a small business owner, or a working couple planning to retire in a few years - our health plans offer a wealth of choices that will help you get the coverage that's just right for you. From individual medical plans to supplement plans, we have you covered.</p>
            <p>Here you will find overviews of many of our health care coverage plans. Each plan has different terms depending on whether you choose to use in-network or out-of-network health care providers.</p>
            <h1>Traditional Plans</h1>
            <p>Our Traditional Plans are a great health coverage option for both individuals and families. Traditional Plans do not meet the minimum requirements for the Affordable Care Act and require medical underwriting that may affect eligibility and rates.</p>
            <p><strong>Nebraska Farm Bureau membership is required.</strong></p>
